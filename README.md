This is another project (Demo) just for learning purposes, I've made it with ReactJs and use little bit of NodeJs Http requests.

What is this application all about?
Ok, this applicatoin (newsapp) is providing news articles sourcing from different websites through Http requests.
again, I've made this project with the help of tutorial but the fun was that the tutorial was quite old, and there was a lot of changes were made in the React technology because of new versions. So, it helped a lot while searching for those problems on google that weren't matching the tutorial and then, solving them.
